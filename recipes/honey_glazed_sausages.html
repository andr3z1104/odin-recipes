    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> It's really no hard work to make sausages from scratch... like the Vikings did. These sausages are packed with good herbs and mustard seeds that pop between your teeth and add a flavoursome kick. Choose a ground pork that is not too lean as it will result in dry sausages. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> 1-2 garlic cloves, finely chopped </li>
        <li> 1-2 handfuls fresh herbs like thyme, sage and marjoram, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons thyme, dried</li>
        <li> 1-2 tablespoons salt </li>
        <li> 2-3 tablespoons mustard seeds </li>
        <li> 400 g ground pork </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup dark beer (100 ml) </li>
        <li> 1-2 pork casings </li>
        <li> Butter for frying </li>
        <li> 1-2 tablespoons honey </li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine the ground pork with garlic, herbs, salt, mustard seeds and beer. Use your hands and make sure it is well mixed.</li>
        <li> Stuff the pork mix into the casings. It really is possible to do this without a mashine, but be careful not to poke through the casing. Make sure to avoid air pockets in the sausages. Make a knot between each sausage.</li>
        <li> Place a pot of water over the fire (or on the grill or cooker). Add the sausages when the water is lukewarm and slowly let is come to a simmer. Let the sausages cook (simmer) for about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Grill the sausages on your garden grill or pan fry the sausages in butter and honey. Melt some butter on a hot pan and add 1-2 tablespoons of honey. Cook the sausages about 5 minutes on each side until golden and glazed. </li>
    </ol>
